Hello, In this project my group was assigned to identify anomalies from a given set of data. We have used excel filtering tool and SQL queries to identify those anomalies.
The anomalies we found was duplicated receipt and staff ids.
We clean those anomalies by using SSIS script to add a D to the receipt and staff ids. The reason why is that we want our data to be as accurate as possible and we can clarify those anomalies later on, omitting those rows can seem very insigificant as there isn't many but in the long run it might heavily affect the data analysis.
